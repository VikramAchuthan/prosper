## What is Prosper?

Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform where people can invest their money in personal loans requested by other people.

## What is the problem you are trying to solve?

It can be difficult for a prospective investor to ascertain if a certain loan will be paid back on time given the data provided to the investor. I aim to build a model that adds an extra degree of confidence for the investor to know that they will be paid back. 

## What is the data set available from Prosper?

The dataset contains more than 100,000 entries, where each entry represents a loan taken out by a user through Prosper, and 81 columns of parameters describing the loan.
